I don't quite feel this is done, but I'm starting to work on other things, so if I don't write this now, I will never do it.

A long long time ago, I was interested in alternative number bases. I started with binary, obviously, then I moved to dozenal, while still playing around with binary every once in a while. I also briefly looked at non-geometric bases, like fibonacci bases.
Then I ventured into irrational territory, while wandering in wikipedia. Which led me to negabinary, then, finally, to complex bases.
And that last one is the one that stuck (aside from the ocasional binary dabbling). So much so that it became my maths-investigation in highschool.

My maths-invetigation was about 1+i as a binary base. I didn't get very far into it. I probably needed another 3 weeks to get anywhere.
I did discover some important things though. I figured out that a base can have repeats, and it can also have numbers that don't appear at all.

After a big while, I decided to investigate it further. I found out (can't remember how) that -1+i was a more promising binary base. By that I mean it was a proper base; it can represent any complex number, with no overlap (other than the "0.999... = 1"esque overlap).
